## ScrapeOps Proxy

This eBay spider uses ScrapeOps Proxy as the proxy solution. ScrapeOps has a free plan that allows you to make up to 1,000 requests per which makes it ideal for the development phase, but can be easily scaled up to millions of pages per month if needs be.

**Get your ScrapeOps API key from https://scrapeops.io/app/register/main/**

To use the ScrapeOps Proxy you need to first install the proxy middleware:
```bash
pip install scrapeops-scrapy-proxy-sdk
```

The proxy is optional. Without a key the spiders request eBay directly, which works for light use, but eBay starts answering 403 after a burst of requests from one IP. To route requests through ScrapeOps, set your API key in the environment:
```bash
export SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
scrapy crawl ebay_search -a query="macbook pro m3"
```
`settings.py` reads the key from `SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY` and enables the proxy only when it is set.

## 📊 Data Analysis Examples

### Python Price Analysis
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load scraped data
search_data = pd.read_csv('data/ebay_search_results.csv')
product_data = pd.read_csv('data/ebay_products.csv')

# Price distribution analysis
search_data['current_price_value'] = pd.to_numeric(search_data['current_price_value'], errors='coerce')
search_data['current_price_value'].hist(bins=50)
plt.title('eBay Price Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Price ($)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Listings')
plt.show()

# Top sellers analysis
top_sellers = search_data.groupby('seller_name').agg({
    'product_title': 'count',
    'current_price_value': 'mean'
}).sort_values('product_title', ascending=False).head(10)

print("Top 10 Sellers by Number of Listings:")
print(top_sellers)

# Deal identification
deals = search_data[
    (search_data['savings_percentage'] > 20) & 
    (search_data['seller_feedback_percentage'] > 98) &
    (search_data['shipping_cost'] == 'Free')
]
print(f"\nFound {len(deals)} potential deals")
```

### Market Intelligence Queries

-- Average prices by condition
SELECT 
    condition,
    COUNT(*) as listing_count,
    AVG(current_price_value) as avg_price,
    MIN(current_price_value) as min_price,
    MAX(current_price_value) as max_price
FROM ebay_search_results 
WHERE current_price_value > 0
GROUP BY condition
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;

-- Top performing sellers
SELECT 
    seller_name,
    COUNT(*) as total_listings,
    AVG(seller_feedback_percentage) as avg_feedback,
    AVG(current_price_value) as avg_price
FROM ebay_search_results 
WHERE seller_feedback_percentage > 95
GROUP BY seller_name
HAVING total_listings >= 5
ORDER BY total_listings DESC;

-- Price trends by search query
SELECT 
    search_query,
    COUNT(*) as listings,
    AVG(current_price_value) as avg_price,
    STDDEV(current_price_value) as price_variance
FROM ebay_search_results
